# ☄️Asteroid Radar App #
Asteroid Radar is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, you can view all the detected asteroids in a period of time, their data (Size, velocity, distance to Earth) and if they are potentially hazardous.

The app consists of two screens: A Main screen with a list of all the detected asteroids and a Details screen that displays the data of that asteroid once it´s selected in the Main screen list. The main screen also shows the NASA image of the day to make the app more striking.

The application:

* Includes the Main screen with a list of clickable asteroids
* Includes a Details screen that displays the selected asteroid data once it’s clicked in the Main screen
* Downloads and parses data from the NASA NeoWS (Near Earth Object Web Service) API.
* Once an asteroid is saved in the database, the list of asteroids is displayed
* The asteroids data is cached by using a worker, so it downloads and saves week asteroids in background when device is charging and wifi is enabled, as well as deleted the asteroids data of the previous day
* App works in multiple screen sizes and orientations, also it provides talk back and push button navigation.

## Instructions for using API ##
To build this project the NASA NeoWS (Near Earth Object Web Service) API is used, which can be found here: https://api.nasa.gov/

In order to run the app, you need an API Key which is provided for you in that same link, just fill the fields in the form and click Signup.

## Dependencies ##
The most important dependencies used are:

* Retrofit to download the data from the Internet.
* Moshi to convert the JSON data we are downloading to usable data in form of custom classes.
* Picasso to download and cache images.
* RecyclerView to display the asteroids in a list.

The following components from the Jetpack library are used:
* ViewModel
* Room
* LiveData
* Data Binding
* Navigation

## Built With
* Android Studio - Default IDE used to build android apps
* Kotlin - Default language used to build this project
* Navigation Component - Android Jetpack's Navigation component, used for Fragment-based navigation
* Retrofit - a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java
* Moshi - a modern JSON library for Android and Java, that makes it easy to parse JSON into Java or Kotlin objects
* Picasso - a powerful image downloading and caching library for Android
* Android Architecture Components - a collection of libraries that help design robust, testable, and maintainable apps: Room (a SQLite object mapping library), LiveData (builds data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes), ViewModel (stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations)
* Data Binding - a Jetpack support library that allows to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically
* MVVM - the architecture pattern used in the app (Model-View-ViewModel), that incorporates the Android Architecture Components
